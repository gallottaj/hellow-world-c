Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Joey Gallotta,

I'm 26, I work in Tech Support for a web-based software company in Southern California. I moved out here about a year ago from Chicago, where I grew up.

I'm a transfer student here at GCU, completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Programming. I completed a coding boot-camp in Chicago about two years ago where I learned how to build web applications in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. This ultimately sparked my passion for technology and lead me to pursue this unique degree offered by GCU. 

In my free time I enjoy exercising, camping, traveling and visiting coffee shops and restaurants.
